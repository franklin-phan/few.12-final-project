      <p>Bubble is a social media application that incentivizes in-person meetups through our intuitive planning system. 
        <br></br>The app does all of the dirty work of planning events around peopleâ€™s schedules, budgets, and 
        preferences for you, 
        <br></br>so you can focus more on having fun with your friends. Users, after inputting their personal interests, 
        location, budget, and contacts,
        <br></br>will be recommended groups based on their interests and what groups their friends are in.
